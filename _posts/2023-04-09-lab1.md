<p>which step causes the biggest delay in the route?what is the average duration of a delay?</p>
```
<h4>As shown above , only one route was used out of 30 hops.it is not showing enough data to determine the delayed route<h4>
```
<h2>what are the main name servers  for the website?</h2>

<h1>reflections:<h1/>During the activity, I learned about the differences between "ipconfig" and "ipconfig/all" commands. "ipconfig" provided basic network configuration details, while "ipconfig/all" gave more comprehensive information. I couldn't determine the delayed route or calculate average delay duration due to limited data. I explored the main name servers and MX record for the website, as well as discovered its hosting location. Overall, the activity provided practical experience in gathering network information and analyzing network routes.
