  <h3>reflection :</h3>
  During this activity, I explored the process of performing a SYN flood attack using Metasploit. I selected "testphp.vulnweb.com" as the target website with the IP address "44.228.249.3". After launching Metasploit and selecting the "auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood" module, I gained a basic understanding of the initial steps involved in setting up the attack. The provided information was limited, but a reference to an external source was given for further exploration of the topic.
