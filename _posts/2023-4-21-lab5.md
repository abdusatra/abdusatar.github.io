.XML External Entities (XXE)
.Broken Access Control
.Security Misconfiguration
.Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
.Insecure Deserialization
.Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

<h1>IEEE Top 10 Vulnerabilities (2021):</h1>


.Hardware and Firmware Security
.Trustworthiness of Machine Learning (ML) Systems
.Insufficient Privacy Protection
.Inadequate Blockchain Security
.Vulnerable Cloud Services
.Insecure Data Sharing
.Insufficient AI Explainability and Accountability
.Insider Threats
.Software Supply Chain Attacks
.Ineffective Incident Response
It's important to note that the OWASP Top 10 focuses specifically on web application security, 
while the IEEE Top 10 covers a broader range of technology-related vulnerabilities.

The OWASP Top 10 includes common vulnerabilities like injection attacks, 
authentication and access control weaknesses, and insecure configurations. 
On the other hand, the IEEE Top 10 encompasses a wider range of concerns, such as hardware and firmware security, privacy protection, machine learning system trustworthiness, and software supply chain attacks.

While both lists address significant security issues, their focus and scope differ.
Organizations should consider both sets of vulnerabilities,
depending on their specific technological context, to ensure comprehensive security measures.
Please note that these lists may be updated or revised beyond my level of knowledge. 
Therefore, it is important to refer to the latest version of each organization for the latest information.
